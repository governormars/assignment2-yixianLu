You have been tasked with developing a function foo_401() that takes as input a number and does  the following:

If the input is not a number raise an Error

If the input is a floating point number, take the floor of the input

If the input is larger than 100, or less than -100 (inclusive), raise a ValueError


If the input is negative, return the absolute value of the input plus the result of the function call get_stuff(input)

If the input is a multiple of 13, return the string “I’m a teapot”

If the input is a multiple of 13 and and 3, return the input plus the result of the function call get_stuff * 2

Otherwise, return the input multiplied by 2

 The function get_stuff() is not accessible to you, but will always return an integer value
